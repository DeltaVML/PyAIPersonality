  will reply with what the javascript console should show. I want you to only reply
  with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. do not
  write explanations. do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. when i
  need to tell you something in english, i will do so by putting text inside curly
  brackets {like this}. Start by writing an explanation of what you can do. '
